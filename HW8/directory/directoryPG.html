    <h1>HW 8</h1>
    <h2>By Abby Burris</h2>
    <p style="color:#1c0053"> 
        For homework 8, I chose to look at an area near my house in Weaverville that has rapidly developed from 2005 to 2022.
           Weaverville is a small town fifteen minutes outside of Asheville. Over the past few decades, Asheville has seen a dramatic increase in residence.
           This has caused nearby towns, like Weaverville, to develop rapidly to accommodate the influx of people. The area in these images show the development of a shopping center and apartment complexes.
